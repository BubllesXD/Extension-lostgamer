# Lostgamer extension

## What is this?
This is an extenstion for lostgamer.io which adds some extra options that should make the game a bit more challenging.

## How does it work?
It is, in a way, similar to changing the HTML/CSS with "inspect element". It reads the HTML then inserts extra elements and changes some styles depending on what options you choose.
It does not send any data anywhere on the internet (for now at least, I'm thinking about making something interesting for multiplayer).

## Why is it shit?
Because I had no idea what I was doing. This is my first browser extension and I am inexperienced. If anyone knows and wishes to make it better but doesn't want to start from scratch,
be my guest and do what you wish with the code.

## How do I download/load it?
I believe that it only works on chromium browsers. It was tested on brave, chrome and edge. For all of those, the steps are similar. The pictures below explain how to load it in edge, but
it is almost identical for chrome/brave (not sure about other browsers).
